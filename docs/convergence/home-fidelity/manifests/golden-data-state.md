# Home Fidelity Golden Data State

Status: bootstrap scaffold only. This file documents the target golden-state contract and the currently exported bootstrap fixtures. The checked-in fixtures do not yet satisfy the approved golden-state checklist.

## Device

- Emulator id: `emulator-5554`
- Physical size: `1080x2400`
- Physical density: `420`
- Crop rectangle:
  - `crop.leftPx: 0`
  - `crop.topPx: 63`
  - `crop.rightPx: 1080`
  - `crop.bottomPx: 2337`

## Commits

- Android build commit: `a35ea2e` (`home-fidelity-implementation`)
- RN reference commit: `1bb58fc` (`home-fidelity-reference-anchors`)

## Target Golden Baseline

- Selected tab: `我的歌单`
- `miniPlayerVisibility: hidden`
- Android package: `com.zili.android.musicfreeandroid`
- RN package: `fun.upup.musicfree`

## Required Checklist

- [ ] `我的歌单 >= 2`
- [ ] `收藏歌单 >= 2`
- [ ] Fixed row order for `我的歌单`
- [ ] Fixed row order for `收藏歌单`
- [ ] Fixed title and subtitle for every row
- [ ] Fixed cover provenance for every row
- [ ] `miniPlayerVisibility: hidden` verified on both Android and RN
- [ ] RN and Android restore flows both reproduce the same semantic home state
- [ ] RN and Android capture flows both reach the required canonical anchors

## Bootstrap Observation

### Android

- Home root anchors visible in `uiautomator dump`:
  - `screen.home.root`
  - `home.navBar.root`
  - `home.operations.root`
  - `home.sheets.root`
- Current selected tab: `我的歌单`
- Current `我的歌单` count: `0`
- Current `收藏歌单` count: `0`
- Visible empty-state text: `暂无歌单`
- Exported fixture files:
  - `fixtures/android/musicfree.db`
  - `fixtures/android/musicfree.db-wal`
  - `fixtures/android/musicfree.db-shm`

### RN

- Exportable storage sources currently available:
  - external MMKV directory path confirmed at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fun.upup.musicfree/files/mmkv`
  - legacy AsyncStorage seed under `fixtures/rn/seed/RKStorage`
  - optional journal under `fixtures/rn/seed/RKStorage-journal`
- Current export caveat:
  - ADB can list the external MMKV directory but cannot read file contents in the current device session, so `fixtures/rn/mmkv/` is present as a placeholder directory and still needs a successful export path.
- Current runtime caveat:
  - the installed debug app requires Metro during this session
  - restore automation is still blocked until a restorable MMKV fixture can be exported
- Current live Metro-backed observation:
  - `screen.home.root`, `home.navBar.root`, `home.navBar.search`, `home.operations.root`, and `home.sheets.root` are visible in `uiautomator dump`
  - current `我的歌单` count: `1`
  - current `收藏歌单` count: `0`
  - current visible local row title: `我喜欢`
  - current visible local row subtitle: `0首`

## Planned Row Inventory

### 我的歌单

| Order | Id | Title | Subtitle | Cover provenance | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | blocked: golden seed data not prepared |
| 2 | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | blocked: golden seed data not prepared |

### 收藏歌单

| Order | Id | Title | Subtitle | Cover provenance | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | blocked: golden seed data not prepared |
| 2 | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | blocked: golden seed data not prepared |

## Controlled Empty

| Fragment | Allowed empty in final golden capture? | Current bootstrap state | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `home-top/nav-bar` | no | not empty | anchor capture is possible on Android bootstrap |
| `home-top/operations` | no | not empty | anchor capture is possible on Android bootstrap |
| `home-sheets/sheets-header` | no | partially visible | header exists but list contract is not satisfied |
| `home-sheets/sheets-list` | no | empty on Android bootstrap | final golden baseline must have at least 2 rows per tab |
| `drawer-open/drawer` | no | unresolved on RN | depends on RN runtime reaching home with anchors |

## Known Blockers

1. Android fixture data is still bootstrap-only; `playlists` and `starred_sheets` are empty.
2. RN external MMKV file export is still blocked by device permissions in the current session; only the legacy `RKStorage` seed has been exported successfully.
3. RN home-top anchors now render with Metro running, but restore automation still cannot reproduce that state because the MMKV fixture payload is unavailable.
4. The approved golden row inventory and cover provenance are still unset.

## Next Actions

1. Seed Android fixtures with at least 2 local playlists and 2 starred sheets.
2. Seed or regenerate RN MMKV fixtures so the same semantic rows exist on the RN home screen.
3. Export a restorable RN MMKV fixture payload, then make `restore-rn-home-state.sh` reproducible.
4. Replace the `TBD` rows above with final approved values and rerun both capture pipelines.
